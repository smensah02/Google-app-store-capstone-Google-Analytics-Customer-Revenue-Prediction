# Google Store Predictive Analysis 
## A Kaggle Challenge 

### Project Description 
The 80/20 rule has proven true for many businessesâ€“only a small percentage of customers produce most of the revenue. As such, marketing teams are challenged to make appropriate investments in promotional strategies.

RStudio, the developer of free and open tools for R and enterprise-ready products for teams to scale and share work, has partnered with Google Cloud and Kaggle to demonstrate the business impact that thorough data analysis can have.

In this competition, We are challenged to analyze a Google Merchandise Store (also known as GStore, where Google swag is sold) customer dataset to predict revenue per customer. Hopefully, the outcome will be more actionable operational changes and a better use of marketing budgets for those companies who choose to use data analysis on top of GA data. https://www.kaggle.com/c/ga-customer-revenue-prediction

### Problem Statement - Predicting How Much a Customer Would Spend at a GStore




### Summary
- We began with trying to predict the how much customers will spend at a gStore.
- We analyze our data, performed some EDA and dropped the necessary columns.
- We tried predicting just on numerical columns and found that to be adequately lacking; we then tried predicting on all remaining columns, both numerical and categorical coloumns, and found that our model performed much better. 
- Though we are scoring at 99% on some of our models, we realize that there is still room for improvement.

## Take Away
> **We could potentially use this model to predict how much a customer will spend on any ecommerce store with similar data collection.**
