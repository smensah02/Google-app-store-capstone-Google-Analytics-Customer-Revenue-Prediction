### Summary
- We began with trying to predict the how much customers will spend at a gStore.
- We analyze our data, performed some EDA and dropped the necessary columns.
- We then tried predicting on just on numerical columns and found that to be adequately lacking.
Intend we tried predicting on all remaining columns both numerical and categorical coloumns and found that our model performed much better. 
- Although we are scoring at 99% on some of our models, we realize that there is still room for improvement on our model.

## Take Away
### - We could potentially use this model to predict how much a customer will spend on any ecommerce store with similar data collection.
