### Requirements

1. Do you have data fully in hand and if not, what blockers are you facing? 
    -- Yes 
2. Have you done a full EDA on all of your data?
    -- Yes
3. Have you begun the modeling process? How accurate are your predictions so far?
    -- No, but should begin in the next day.
4. What blockers are you facing, including processing power, data acquisition, modeling difficulties, data cleaning, etc.? How can we help you overcome those challenges?
    -- [data cleaning], but already had a one on one with my instruction and now know what direction to take.
5. Have you changed topics since your lightning talk? Since you submitted your Problem Statement and EDA? If so, do you have the necessary data in hand (and the requisite EDA completed) to continue moving forward?
    -- Yes, I went with my 2nd option as opposed to my first, because data and predictive question was easily assessible.
6. What is your timeline for the next week and a half? What do you have to get done versus what would you like to get done?
    -- Do a bit more data cleaning, modeling, predictions and create my slides and executive summary for presentation.
